# CounselFlow Ukraine - System Architecture

## Overview

CounselFlow Ukraine is a comprehensive legal management platform designed specifically for Ukrainian legal professionals. The system follows a modern monorepo architecture with clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and shared components.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Monorepo Structure**
- **Centralized codebase** with multiple applications and packages
- **Shared dependencies** and common configuration
- **Consistent tooling** across all packages
- **Simplified deployment** and version management

### 2. **Domain-Driven Design**
- **Business logic separation** by legal domains (matters, contracts, risks, etc.)
- **Clear boundaries** between different legal practice areas
- **Consistent data models** across frontend and backend

### 3. **Security-First Approach**
- **Zero-trust architecture** with comprehensive authentication
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) for different user types
- **Data encryption** for sensitive legal information
- **Audit logging** for compliance requirements
